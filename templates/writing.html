            Much of my writing can be found on my <a href="http://derivativetrash.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. I would consider myself a fiction writer first and foremost; <br>
            however the tumblr blog is mostly focused on my poetry. It is all very stream of consciousness, and I rarely<br>
            think twice before posting something. I try not to take it too seriously, and just try to express myself the best I can. <br>
